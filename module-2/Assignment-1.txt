Hello, Haskell!
Objective: To become familiar with Haskell syntax and basic program structure.

Task: In this introductory assignment, students will write a simple Haskell program that prints "Hello, Haskell!" to the console. The goal is to encourage students to explore Haskell's syntax, define functions, and use type annotations where necessary.

Instructions:

Scenario:

Haskell is known for its elegant and concise syntax. This assignment aims to help you take your first steps in writing Haskell code.

Your Task:

Write a Haskell program that does the following:

Prints the message "Hello, Haskell!" to the console.
a. Function Use (Optional): If you are comfortable with Haskell's function syntax, you can create a function that returns the message and then call that function to print the message.

b. Type Annotations (Optional): Experiment with adding type annotations to your program elements (e.g., function definitions, variables) where you think it's appropriate. This will help you get acquainted with Haskell's strong type system.

Code Implementation:

Write your Haskell code for the program. You can use a code editor or Haskell REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to write and test your code.

Documentation:

Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining its purpose and how it achieves the task.

Part 2: Testing and Execution

Test your Haskell program to ensure it successfully prints "Hello, Haskell!" to the console.
Part 3: Submission

Submit your Haskell program code as a text file or document.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness: The program should successfully print "Hello, Haskell!" to the console.

Code Quality: Code should be well-structured and readable, with meaningful variable and function names.

Documentation: Code should be adequately documented with comments explaining its purpose.
