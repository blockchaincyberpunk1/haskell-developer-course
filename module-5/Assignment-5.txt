Integrating Type Classes, Lazy Evaluation, and Infinite Data
Objective: To integrate various advanced concepts in Haskell, including type classes, lazy evaluation, and infinite data structures.

Task: In this assignment, you will challenge yourself to solve a complex computational problem that requires the integration of type classes, lazy evaluation, and infinite data structures in Haskell. This assignment will test your mastery of advanced Haskell concepts.

Instructions:

Part 1: Problem Statement

The problem you need to solve involves generating and processing infinite sequences of data efficiently. You can choose one of the following problem scenarios or propose your own:

a. Infinite Prime Generator: Implement an infinite list of prime numbers using a lazy sieve algorithm. Then, design a program that utilizes this infinite list to perform operations such as finding the nth prime number, generating prime factorizations, or solving prime-related computational challenges.

b. Fractal Generation: Create a program that generates fractal images, such as the Mandelbrot or Julia sets, using an infinite data structure to represent the complex plane. Explore the beauty of fractal images and perform operations like zooming, rendering specific regions, or calculating fractal dimensions.

c. Infinite Series: Design a program that explores infinite mathematical series like the Fibonacci sequence, harmonic series, or Taylor series. Utilize these series for computations such as approximating mathematical constants, calculating limits, or solving numerical problems.

Part 2: Implementation

Develop your Haskell program to tackle the chosen problem scenario. Pay special attention to the following aspects:

Efficient generation of infinite data structures using lazy evaluation.
