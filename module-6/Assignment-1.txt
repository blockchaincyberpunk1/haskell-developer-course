CLI Task Manager
Objective: To build a command-line task management application using Haskell.

Task: In this assignment, you will create a command-line task management application in Haskell. The application should allow users to add, list, update, and delete tasks, providing a basic but functional task manager.

Instructions:

Part 1: Application Requirements

Your task manager application should support the following commands:

Add: Users can add new tasks to the task list.
List: Users can view a list of all tasks with their status (e.g., incomplete/complete).
Update: Users can mark tasks as complete or update task descriptions.
Delete: Users can delete tasks from the list.
Quit: Users can exit the application.
Tasks should have the following attributes:

Task ID (unique identifier)
Description (textual description of the task)
Status (complete or incomplete)
The application should maintain a list of tasks in memory. It does not need to support data persistence between application runs.

Part 2: Implementation

Develop your Haskell application to fulfill the requirements mentioned above. Pay attention to the following:

Command-line argument parsing to execute the desired command.
Management of the task list, including adding, listing, updating, and deleting tasks.
Proper formatting and display of tasks in the CLI interface.
Part 3: User Interaction

Implement a user-friendly command-line interface that guides users through using the application. Ensure clear instructions and feedback.
Part 4: Testing and Verification

Thoroughly test your application with various scenarios and commands to ensure correct functionality. Test both valid and invalid inputs.
Part 5: Documentation and Report

Document your Haskell code with comments, explaining the functionality of various components.

Write a brief report describing your application, including any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

Part 6: Submission

Submit your Haskell code along with the report describing your implementation and the testing results.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct and efficient implementation of the CLI task manager application.

Adherence to the specified application requirements, including proper handling of commands and task management.

User-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions and feedback.

Thorough testing, including scenarios with both valid and invalid inputs.

Quality of the report, providing insights into your implementation process and any challenges faced.

Overall clarity, readability, and correctness of your Haskell code.
