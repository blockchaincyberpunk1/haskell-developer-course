Web Application with Yesod or Scotty
Objective: To extend your Haskell skills by building a web application using a Haskell web framework.

Task: In this optional assignment, you have the opportunity to create a simple web application using a Haskell web framework such as Yesod or Scotty. This assignment aims to give you hands-on experience in developing a web interface and implementing functionality in Haskell.

Instructions:

Part 1: Framework Selection

Choose a Haskell web framework for your project. You can opt for either Yesod or Scotty, depending on your preference and familiarity.
Part 2: Web Application Development

Develop a simple web application that includes the following components:

User Interface: Design and create a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and any frontend libraries or tools of your choice.

Functionality: Implement at least two distinct features or functionalities within your web application. These functionalities can involve user interactions, data storage, or any other suitable tasks. Examples include a to-do list manager, a blog platform, a chat application, or a content management system.

Database Interaction (Optional): If your project requires data storage, consider integrating a database into your application. You can use a lightweight database system like SQLite or PostgreSQL and interact with it using Haskell libraries.

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages to users when something goes wrong.

Part 3: User Interaction and Testing

Create a user guide or documentation explaining how users can interact with your web application. Provide clear instructions on how to use the features you've implemented.

Thoroughly test your web application, including user interactions and error scenarios. Ensure that the application behaves as expected and handles errors gracefully.

Part 4: Deployment (Optional)

If you choose to deploy your web application, provide instructions or a brief report on how you deployed it. You can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other hosting service.
Part 5: Documentation and Report

Document your Haskell code with comments, explaining the functionality of various components.

Write a comprehensive report describing your web application, including its purpose, features, and how it fulfills the assignment objectives.

Part 6: Submission (Optional)

If you decide to submit your assignment, provide the source code of your Haskell web application, documentation, and the report.
Evaluation Criteria:

If you choose to complete this optional assignment, it will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Choice of Framework: The selection of Yesod or Scotty and the rationale behind the choice.

Web Application Functionality: The implementation of at least two distinct features or functionalities within your web application.

User Interface: The design and user-friendliness of the web interface.

Database Integration (if applicable): The successful integration of a database into your application and data retrieval/manipulation.

Error Handling: Effective error handling mechanisms and meaningful error messages.

User Guide: Clear and concise user instructions for interacting with your web application.

Testing: Thorough testing to ensure correct functionality and graceful error handling.

Documentation: Quality documentation in your Haskell code.

Report: The clarity and comprehensiveness of the report, including the application's purpose and features.

Deployment (if applicable): Deployment instructions or a report on the deployment process.
