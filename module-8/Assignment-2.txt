Attend a Haskell Meetup or Conference
Objective: To encourage students to participate in physical or virtual Haskell events.

Task: In this assignment, you will attend a Haskell meetup, conference, or webinar either physically or virtually. The goal is to immerse yourself in the Haskell community, learn from experts, and gain insights into Haskell development practices.

Instructions:

Select an Event: Choose a Haskell meetup, conference, or webinar to attend. You can find Haskell-related events on websites like Meetup, Eventbrite, or conference websites.

Attend the Event: Participate in the chosen event by attending presentations, workshops, or discussions. Take notes during the event to capture key takeaways, interesting ideas, or topics discussed.

Summarize Your Experience: After attending the event, write a summary of your experience. Include the following details:

Event Details: Provide information about the event, such as its name, date, location (if physical), or platform (if virtual).

Key Takeaways: Share the most important lessons, insights, or ideas you gained from the event. Highlight any presentations or workshops that stood out to you.

Speakers and Topics: Mention the names of notable speakers and their presentations or topics. Describe what you found valuable in their talks.

Benefits to Your Haskell Learning Journey: Reflect on how attending this event benefits your understanding of Haskell, your skill development, or your connection to the Haskell community.

Share Your Thoughts: Share your thoughts on the event with your peers or classmates. Discuss what you learned, what excited you, or any challenges you encountered.
