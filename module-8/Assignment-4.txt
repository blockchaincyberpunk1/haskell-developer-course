Blog or Tutorial Review
Objective: To stay informed about Haskell developments through blogs and tutorials.

Task: In this assignment, you will engage with the Haskell community by reading a recent Haskell-related blog post or tutorial. Your task is to write a review or summary of the content, reflecting on what you learned, any challenges you encountered, and how the content contributes to your Haskell knowledge.

Instructions:

Select a Haskell Blog Post or Tutorial: Choose a recent Haskell-related blog post or tutorial that interests you. You can explore platforms like Medium, dev.to, personal blogs, or educational websites. Ensure that the content is recent (preferably within the last six months) and relevant to Haskell development.

Read and Study: Thoroughly read and study the chosen blog post or tutorial. Pay attention to the concepts, techniques, or tools discussed, and try to understand their practical applications.

Write a Review or Summary: Write a review or summary of the content. Your review should include the following aspects:

Introduction: Begin with a brief introduction to the blog post or tutorial, including the title and author.
Summary: Summarize the main points or takeaways from the content. What is the content about, and what Haskell-related topics or concepts does it cover?
