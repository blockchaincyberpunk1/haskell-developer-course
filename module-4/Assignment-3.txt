Creating Custom Monads
Objective: To explore the concept of custom monads in Haskell.

Task: In this assignment, students will dive deeper into the world of monads by creating their custom monad for a specific domain or use case. Custom monads allow programmers to encapsulate specific types of computations or effects, making code more expressive and maintainable. Students will design and implement a custom monad and write functions that operate within this monad, showcasing how it encapsulates a particular type of computation.

Instructions:

Part 1: Understanding Custom Monads

Scenario:

In Haskell, monads provide a way to encapsulate certain types of computations or effects, such as state, error handling, or non-determinism. Custom monads can be created to represent domain-specific computations, making the code more expressive and easier to reason about.

Your Task:

You are required to design and implement a custom monad for a specific domain or use case. This custom monad should encapsulate a particular type of computation or effect relevant to the chosen domain. Additionally, you should write Haskell functions that operate within this custom monad to demonstrate its usefulness.

Part 2: Custom Monad Implementation

Choose a Domain:

Select a domain or use case for which you want to create a custom monad. Examples of domains include database interactions, game logic, configuration management, or any other area where a specific type of computation is prevalent.

Define the Custom Monad:

Implement the custom monad using Haskell's monad type classes. Define the monadic operations and any specific behavior relevant to your chosen domain.

Write Functions:

Create Haskell functions that operate within the custom monad. These functions should perform computations or effects specific to the chosen domain and demonstrate how the custom monad encapsulates this behavior.

Part 3: Testing and Validation

Test your custom monad and the functions that use it with various input scenarios to ensure that it behaves correctly within the chosen domain.

Include test cases that cover different aspects of your custom monad's behavior and functionality.

Part 4: Real-World Application

Apply your custom monad to a real-world scenario or use case within the chosen domain. Write a Haskell program that demonstrates the practical use of your custom monad and its benefits in this context.
Part 5: Submission

Submit your Haskell code for the custom monad, including its implementation and functions that use it, along with a report that includes the following:
A description of the chosen domain or use case for the custom monad.
An explanation of how the custom monad is designed and how it encapsulates the chosen computation or effect.
The results of testing the custom monad and the functions within it.
A description of the real-world application where the custom monad is applied and its practical significance.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct and well-structured implementation of the custom monad, including the definition of monadic operations and any specific behavior relevant to the chosen domain.

Quality and clarity of code documentation and comments, especially in explaining how the custom monad is used and its benefits.

Effectiveness of testing and validation, including a discussion of the results and how the custom monad behaves in different scenarios.

Creativity and practicality of the real-world application of the custom monad within the chosen domain.
